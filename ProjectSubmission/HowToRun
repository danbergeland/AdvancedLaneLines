To run this software:
Ensure that you have an environment with opencv and all required python libraries.
I built this in an anaconda environment using 'conda install opencv', and using pip for numpy and other required python modules.

use the following command to encode the project video:

python lane_find_video.py project_video.mp4

To run the code on a single frame:

python lanefinding.py test3.jpg

The outputs will appear in the 'outputs' folder in the project directory.
